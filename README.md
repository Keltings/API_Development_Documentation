# API Development and Documentation Project

## The Trivia App

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game.

This particular App holds trivias and sees who is the most knowledgeable of the bunch. The application does the following:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. 
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
